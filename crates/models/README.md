# models

The protocol's promises, written once as properties and explored over the real
code.

A model is a `Machine`: a slice of real state, the actions its environment may
take, a transition that calls the real code, and a list of properties. Each
property reads as a sentence a person would argue over and is a predicate over
the state:

- **always** holds in every explored state;
- **sometimes** holds in at least one, so an `always` cannot pass on a machine
  that does nothing;
- **eventually** holds somewhere on every path that ends because no action is
  enabled. The checker has no fairness, so a model writes liveness in with a
  bound on consecutive faults.

`check(model, bounds)` explores every state breadth first within the bounds and
prints the shortest path to a failing state. `walk(model, bounds, seed)` follows
one schedule chosen by the seed: the same seed walks the same schedule on every
run, so a failing walk is reproduced by its seed alone.

Run the models with `just test-crate models`.
